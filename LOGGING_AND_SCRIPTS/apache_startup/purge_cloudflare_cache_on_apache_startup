There are two scripts 

1) notify_script -> checks whether inotifywait is still running
	- if it does, exits
	- if not, starts listening for change in desired folders and logs messages in log file

2) kill_all -> checks whether inotifywait is running
	- if it does, checks if notify_script is running. If true kills both 
	- if it doesn't, exits. 


3) check how apache2 is started. Run 

service apache2 status

a) case ExecStop=/etc/init.d/apache2 stop


	In /etc/init.d/apache2 startup file,  call to scripts are to be included in 

	do_start() / do_stop / do_reload() 


b)  case ExecStop=/usr/sbin/apachectl

	in /usr/sbin/apachectl, calls to script are to be included in 

	start)
	restart|graceful)
	stop|graceful-stop)
