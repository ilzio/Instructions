MODSECURITY LOGGING:

1 - to know how many times rule has been triggered execute: 

	grep ModSecurity /var/log/apache2/error.log.1 | sed -e 's#^.*\[id "\([0-9]*\).*hostname "\([a-z0-9\-\_\.]*\)"\].*uri "#\1 \2 #' | cut -d\" -f1 | sort -n | uniq -c | sort -n

this will show 
 - number of time rule has been triggered 
 - ID of the rule triggered
 - ip and uri of last trigger 

 ex: 1682 9142050 172.16.0.73 /login
