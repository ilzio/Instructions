create new program launcher in unity

1) create file called [application-name].desktop and save it to 
~/.local/share/applications (suspect that also saving it to /usr/share/applications/ works...)

2)change values as needed

#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open

[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Exec=command to run here
Name=visible name here
Comment=comment here
Icon=icon path here
